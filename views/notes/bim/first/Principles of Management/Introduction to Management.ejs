        <h3 class="subTopic">How to become a Manager?</h3>
        <p>Generally, the efficiency and capability of a manager is judged by the success and failure of his/her
            organization. There are various factors that determines the effectiveness of a manager. However, the
            role of education, experience and situation had large impact in making a manager efficient and effective.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li><span class="highlight emphasis">Role of Education</span>
                <p class="ml20 mt20 mb20">Management is regarded as emerging profession and this subject is learnt and
                    taught in many colleges and universities. One can graduate in this subject and can earn his/her
                    living. If a manager is educated he/she has theoretical knowledge which he/she can put into
                    practice. On the other hand, if a manager is uneducated he/she may not have proper
                    knowledge regarding management. Therefore, education plays important role in managerâs life.
                    If a manager has proper knowledge regarding management he/she can be more effective and
                    efficient in managing the organization.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="highlight emphasis">Role of Experience</span>
                <p class="ml20 mt20 mb20">Another factor affecting the efficiency and effectiveness of a manager is
                    experience. Experienced manager can handle managerial problems more tactfully and smoothly
                    as compared to unexperienced manager. An experienced manager can make right decision at
                    right time. He/she deals positively with the employees. On the other hand, manager lacking
                    experience may be unable to solve managerial problems and becomes ineffective. Therefore,
                    experience plays vital role to make manager efficient and effective.</p>
            </li>
            <li><span class="highlight emphasis">Role of Situation</span>
                <p class="ml20 mt20 mb20">Situation is an important factor to determine the effectiveness of a manager.
                    A
                    manager can perform the task very smoothly in one situation and the same manager may
                    perform the same task in an inefficient manner in another situation. Therefore, only those
                    managers who can adopt the changes easily and act according to the situation can be effective
                    and efficient.</p>
